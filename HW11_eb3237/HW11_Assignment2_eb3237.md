## Instructions: Improve your plot from HW8 based on the feedback you recieved from your classmates


## Feedback No.1:
### eb3237_plotReview_ss12513.md

Two plots have been created to show the median house prices in five cities for the past one year. 
From the first plot it is easy to understand the changes in price for each city in the past 12 months. 
The quantities being visualized have been shown clearly. 
The colors for the graph have been limited to 6 and the graphical elements have been chosen appropriately. 
From the second plot is easy to understand the changes in price for each city in the past 12 months 
as well as compare the prices between cities. The plot reproduces the information visually. 
The first plot can be improved by starting the y –axis from zero and using horizontal bars.

Suggestions
The plot looks very good but I think there is one thing worth to be suggested. 
Compare this two plot, we could find they convey the same information and the second one is more clear. 
In this case, we could only keep one plot.

## Plot improvements:

Both reviewers did not suggest any specific improvements to my existing plots. Also, the suggestions are somewhat contradictory.

However, for the purpose of the assignment, I am creating a new plot and uploading it below. 

I am improving the first plot by starting the y –axis from zero. I am not using horizontal bars as they would look really ugly and uninformative.
