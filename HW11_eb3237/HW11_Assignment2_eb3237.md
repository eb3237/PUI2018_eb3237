## Instructions: Improve your plot from HW8 based on the feedback you recieved from your classmates


## Feedback No.1:

[Review from_ss12513](https://github.com/eb3237/PUI2018_eb3237/blob/master/HW8_eb3237/eb3237_plotReview_ss12513.md)

Suggestion:
The first plot can be improved by starting the y –axis from zero and using horizontal bars.

## Feedback No.2:

[Review from_ml6506](https://github.com/eb3237/PUI2018_eb3237/blob/master/HW8_eb3237/eb3237_plotReview_ml6506.md)


Suggestion:
The plot looks very good but I think there is one thing worth to be suggested. 
Compare this two plot, we could find they convey the same information and the second one is more clear. 
In this case, we could only keep one plot.

## Plot improvements:

Both reviewers did not suggest any specific improvements to my existing plots. Also, the suggestions are somewhat contradictory.

However, for the purpose of the assignment, I am creating a new plot and uploading it below. 

I am improving the first plot by starting the y –axis from zero. The reason I did not do that initially is because it does not actually make sense: house prices never start from zero, and for the purpose of my analysis, in Texas it made a perfect sense to start from $200K. I dont see that the plot has been improved. 

I am not using horizontal bars as they would look really ugly and uninformative.
